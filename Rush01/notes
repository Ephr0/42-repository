DO ONCE.

4 check - 
Any value of 4 fills its entire row / colum with 1, 2, 3, 4. In order

1 check
Any value of 1, must have a 4 as its closest value.

Loop until done:

"Check if you have a single missing space on any row or column, and fill it"
Eg. If a row has, 1, 3, 4, the only missing value is a 2.

"Check if you have 3 of a kind of a single number placed"
If you have placed 3 4's, there is only 1 legal space for a 4 left, iterate through rows / columns to find it and place it.

"Check spaces for only a single legal move"
X = doesnt matter
e = empty / unknown

if	4 = (1, 2, 3, 4)

if	1 = (4, x, x, x)

if	2 = (e, e, e, 4) = first e must be 3
if 	2 = (e, e, 4, x) = first e must be 3 or 2, if x is a 3 or 2 you know what the first empty is, 2nd empty could be a 1 or 2
if	2 = (e, e, 4, 3) = first e must be a 2, second must be a 1.
If	2 = (e, e, 4, 2) = first e must be a 3, second 1
If	2 = (e, e, 4, 1) = first e must be a 3, second 2

if	2 = (e, 4, x, x) = first number could be 1, 2 or 3
If	2 = (2, 4, x, x)
If	2 = (3, 4, x, x)
if 	2 = (e, e, 2, 3) = empties must be 1, 4.
If	2 = (3, e, e, e) any empty could be a 4
If	2 = (2, e, e, e) first empty could be 1 or 4
If	2 = (2, 1, e, e) = first empty must be a 4
If	2 = (1, e, e, e) = first empty must be a 4


if	3 = (2, e, e, 4) = first e must be a 3, second e must be a 1
if	3 = (e, e, 1, 4) = first e must be a 2, second must be 3

if	3 = (e, e, 4, 3) = must be 1, 2
if 	3 = (2, 3, e, e) = first empty must be a 4, second must be a 1
if 	3 = (e, e, 2, 4) = empties must be 1, 3 (no block, no block, block, no block)

the number you want to see tells you how many you want to see. But also how many numbers should be blocked.
4 means none blocked, means every digit must be smaller than the next one
1 means 3 are blocked, means after the first digit all must be blocked
2 means 2 are blocked, which means there is either a 4 in the second space, or a 4 blocks one number, and a 2 or 3 must block a 1 or 2.
3 meanas 1 is blocked, which could be a 2 blocks a 1, a 3 blocks a 2, or a 4 blocks 1, 2, 3;






difference between how many you already see, how many you want to see, and how many you have to block.



if 3 = (1, empty, 4) empty could be a 2 or 3 
if 2 = (empty, empty, empty 4) - first empty must be 3.

If 2 =(1, x, x, x) = 1 can't block anything, next must be a 4
If 2 =(2, x, x, x) = 2 can only block 1, if is blocking 1 next must be a 4
If 2 =(3, x, x, x) = 3 can block a 2 and/ or 1, any could be a 4

If 3 = (1, x, x, x) = 1 can't block anything, third must be a 4, second can be 2 or 3
If 3 = (2, x, x, x) = 2 can block 1, in any space, must see a 3 before a 4
3 can't be (
